  depends-on:
    type: string
    description: |
      Kconfig symbol that instance depends on in order to be compiled into
      build. This is required so devicetree nodes can permanently exist
      with `status=okay` while enabling users to determine whether it is
      safe to get a compile-time reference with `DEVICE_DT_GET`. Otherwise
      every application would require board specific overlays to set `status`
      depending on the Kconfig features enabled.
  max-packet-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Maximum packet size (header + payload + footer) supported
      by the interface. If not set, supports arbitrary sized
      payloads (limited by CONFIG_EPACKET_PACKET_SIZE_MAX).
  header-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Size of the interface header in bytes.
      Do NOT modify defaults.
  footer-size:
    type: int
    description: |
      Size of the interface footer in bytes
      Do NOT modify defaults.
