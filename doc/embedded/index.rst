Overview
########

The Infuse-IoT embedded stack is built on top of the `Zephyr Project`_, a
next-generation real-time operating system managed by the `Linux Foundation`_.

Our stack is architectured as a collection of software libraries which aim to
implement a large portion of the functionality required by every embedded IoT
application. Each library is written in line with the :ref:`platform-design-goals`,
allowing their re-use in any application.
